         <div id="interview">

            <p><span class="SH">Sean Hannity (SH): </span>Hi John, good to have you on the show again, how are you?</p>

            <p><span class="JS">John Skerritt (JS): </span>Hey Sean, what's going on?  How was your evening?</p>

            <p><span class="SH">SH: </span>So John, you've been traveling all over the northeast doing rallies and talking to voters.  How was your recent visit to the white house?</p>

            <p><span class="JS">JS: </span>Let me tell you Sean, I went to visit those guys, and they're a bunch of knuckleheads.  All those guys.  These clowns have no idea what they're doing.</p>

            <p><span class="SH">SH: </span>You've been talking about government reform for a long time now, what do you think the primary issue facing Americans is right now?</p>

            <p><span class="JS">JS: </span>You know, it's all about the money.  You know that, right?  That's all they care about, all they care about is revenue coming in.  That's no way to manage a government.  They don't know what they're doing.</p>

            <p><span class="SH">SH: </span>What do you recommend your constituency to do?</p>

            <p><span class="JS">JS: </span>Look let's face it.  I don't mean to be rude, but most of my voters are idiots.  I'm sorry, but your average voter is not very intelligent.  The best thing they can do is vote for me, while I still care.  I've been a senator in Maine for over 35 years now, and my state pretty much manages itself.  We don't need these clowns telling us what to do, they have no idea what they're doing.</p>

            <p><span class="SH">SH: </span>One of your main campaign points relates to student loans, which people are claiming is now the second largest source of debt in the country.  What do you have to say to all these young people who have chosen to take on so much debt and now complain that they can't pay it back?</p>

            <p><span class="JS">JS: </span>These kids, they have no idea.  When we were younger we had to work our asses off.  These kids who get themselves into debt are a bunch of idiots.  I'm sorry, but they are.  They can't handle any stress. They have to just get a damn job and stop complaining.  No one is going to hand anything to you.  I say to them, "Get a job, and trust in Jesus."</p>

            <p><span class="SH">SH: </span>I mean don't they understand what a loan is.  Its not like its a handout, you have to pay it back!  I think there's an air of entitlement that's become too common among our population.</p>

            <p><span class="JS">JS: </span>Absolutely Sean, absolutely.</p>

            <p><span class="SH">SH: </span>Recently Senator Kamala Harris made mention that school should be free for students.  She's claiming that schools should be paid for by the taxpayers.  Clearly she's promoting socialist.  What do you think of that?</p>

            <p><span class="JS">JS: </span>I don't think anyone should be taking advice from Kamala Harris.</p>

            <p><span class="SH">SH: </span>Because of her connections to the muslim brotherhood?</p>

            <p><span class="JS">JS: </span>Yes, that. But also, I mean, she's a woman!  <i>*Makes cat meow noises*</i></p>
